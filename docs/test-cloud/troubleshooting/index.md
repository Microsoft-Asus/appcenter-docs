# Test Troubleshooting
The documents in this section provide general troubleshooting tips for App Center Test. 

## General Tips
If you're unsure how to diagnose your issue, here are some general tips:

- **Confirm your tests work locally**. Ideally compare similar device model(s) and OS versions to minimize variables.
- **Compare working vs. failing devices in Test that have at least one variable in common**. For example, OS version, model, or form factor. 
- **iOS simulator app packages can't be uploaded to Test**. Test requires a iOS device build (IPA) that our system can re-sign using our Development Provisioning files. 
- **Your test suite might need [extra time](time-outs.md) or a [server connection](server-connection.md)** to reliably pass tests in App Center.
- **Test can't automate multiple apps, or system apps (browser, camera, and so on)**. This limitation is true even for testing frameworks that allow full system control locally. 
- **Only include DLLs required for your test suite itself, not the app being tested**. If you include DLLs used by the app being tested, you may observe unexpected behavior such as stalls or other strange symptoms.
